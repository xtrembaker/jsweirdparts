// Conceptual Aside - Single Threaded, synchronous Execution

// Single Threaded :
// - One command is being executed at a time
// - Under the hood of the browser, Javascript is not the only thing happening in the browser.

// Synchronous :
// One at a time (one line of code being executed at a time)
// And in order

// What about AJAX ? Will see that in a bit
