// - Primitive Types 

//Primitive type:
// - A type of data that represents a single value.
// - That is not an object
// - There is 6 primitives types in javascript

// undefined : represents lack of existence (keep the engine manage that value)
// null : represents lack of existence (you can set a variable to this).
// Boolean : true or false
// Number : Floating point number (there's always some decimals). Unlike other programming languages, there's only one number type ... and it can make math weird.
// String : a sequence of characters (both quote and single quote and can be used)
// Symbol : Used in ES6 (the next version of javascript)
